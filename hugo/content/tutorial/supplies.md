I recommend the Cameo 5 Alpha because it's the latest and greatest from Silhouette. I use the Cameo 5 which is similar to and has been replaced by the Cameo 5 Alpha. However, if the cost is too prohibitive, you can consider the Cameo 4. The [Cameo 4 Plus]( https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-plus?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) is still available and it's cheaper than the Cameo 5 but also larger. Another option is the [Portrait 4](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/portrait-4?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link), which is compact (only supporting letter and A4 size material) but lacks a dual tool carriage. Regardless of the machine, I recommend purchasing the machine only and avoiding bundles as they're not relevant to card cutting.

I recommend this laminator for a few reasons. First, it's not particularly expensive compared to others. Second, most laminators support only one or two hot settings (3 and 5 mil). This is the only reasonably priced laminator I've found with 4 hot settings: 3, 4, 5, and 6 mil. Because laminators are built for printer paper and not card stock, it's helpful to have these additional settings to ensure lamination quality. Lastly, this laminator is wide, which makes it easy to feed sheets and finish cards.

I don't have a printer recommendation because people buy printers for different reasons. There isn't a one size fits all printer that I can suggest. If you're unsure about the whole card cutting thing, I suggest you first ask a friend or a family member with a printer or go to a print shop for your initial testing. This way, if for whatever reason you don't think it's going to work out, you only have one expensive purchase to deal with instead of two.

However, if you'd still like some printer advice, I can give some pointers. You'll likely want an inkjet printers as they are better for producing high quality photos and laser toner can adversely affect lamination adhesion. You'll want a duplex printing so you can do cards with backs but, keep in mind that not all duplex printers can handle the thickness of card stock. Worst case scenario, you can always do manual duplex.

As for some suggestions, the EcoTank line of printers are popular among proxy makers as they can provide great results while also being affordable. For a budget option, consider the [ET-2850](https://amzn.to/4kk7tGx), which supports duplex printing and uses pigment-based black ink, which provides better contrast than dye based. Above that, consider the [ET-3850](https://amzn.to/3SZwXOb), which has the previous features and an auto document feeder (ADF), making it a great office printer. At the high end, consider the [ET-8500](https://amzn.to/3G2eu0w) and the [ET-8550](https://amzn.to/444jQBH), which support duplex printing and utilize 6 inks (including black pigment, black dye, and grey dye) making them the best photo printers. The main difference between the ET-8500 and the ET-8550 is that the latter supports wide format printing, which enables you to use larger paper sizes like tabloid and A3 size and cut more cards before changing mats.

Some Silhouette machines have Bluetooth connectivity, but it is known to be spotty. I highly recommend picking up a printer cable, even if as a back up.

## Materials

* Printer ink
* [Double-sided glossy card stock](https://amzn.to/4my5LlX)
* [Lamination pouches](https://amzn.to/3E5yE8M)
* [Post-it notes](https://amzn.to/4a9LVZX)

Use glossy card stock for better lamination clarity.

I recommend glossy lamination pouches as they function well and they're cheaper and more wildly available than matte lamination pouches. Matte lamination pouches may also reduce the contrast and color saturation of your prints.

Post-it notes are used to improve registration accuracy. However, you must use Post-it notes that are lightly colored. The idea is to cover parts of the print that may confuse the cutting machine, so whatever you use should be similar to blank paper. If you do not have Post-it notes, you can also a piece of paper or some masking tape, as long as whatever you use is lightly colored.

## Optional
* [Extra cutting mats (12 x 12 in)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cut-mat-12-3t-c?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) (coupon code: `DIYBOARDGAMES`) / [Amazon alternative](https://amzn.to/3GKwigs)
* [Extra cutting blades (AutoBlade)](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/silh-blade-auto-2?affiliate_code=uKx6VtFWmI&referring_service=link) (coupon code: `DIYBOARDGAMES`) / [Amazon alternative](https://amzn.to/3GMN8eM)
* [Hobby knife with cutting mat](https://amzn.to/41UT2CF)

You'll want to pick up extra cutting mats. Cutting mats are sticky and they hold the sheet as its being cut. Over time, they'll lose their stickiness and must be replaced. Additionally, it's nice to have extra mats so you can prep one as another one is being cut. Each mat should last for a few hundred cards or a few dozen sheets as long as you take care of them.

The Cameo 5 can cut a lot of materials including tough materials like corrugated paper, chipboard, and wood. However, if you're only cutting cards, your blade should last a long time. At the same time, if you're new to these machines, you could accidentally break the blade due to improper set up. Consider buying an extra as a back up.

A hobby knife and a (non-sticky) cutting mat can come in handy. Occasionally, the Cameo will leave you a straggler card where it's not completely detached. You can use the hobby knife to finish the cut.
